Run MongoDB:
------------

  The MongoDB instance stores its data files in /var/lib/mongodb and its log
files in /var/log/mongodb, and runs using the mongodb user account.

the access control rights to the /var/lib/mongodb and /var/log/mongodb directories.

    - sudo /etc/init.d/mongod start

  2. Verify that MongoDB has started successfully:

    - Verify that the mongod process has started successfully by checking
      the contents of the log file at /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log.

  3. Stop MongoDB:

    - As needed, you can stop the mongod process by issuing the following
      command:

    - sudo /etc/init.d/mongod stop

  4. Restart MongoDB:

    - sudo /etc/init.d/mongod restart
